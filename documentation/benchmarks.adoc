== Benchmarks
For evaluating the performance of Woorpje, we automatically generated
two  collections of word equations that exhibit a special
structure. The collections both contain 200 word equations that are guaranteed to be satisfiable. The
equations are solved with Woorpje and state of the art string solvers
(http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/web/[CVC4], https://github.com/z3str/Z3-str[Z3str], Z3Seg and http://user.it.uu.se/~jarst116/norn/[Norn]).

For each word equation we ran the solvers and noted if they gave the
correct result, if they timed out and we measured the total time for
solving all equations. The solvers were allowed to run for 30
seconds.


=== Random Formulas
The collection of word equations are completely random word
equations.
