= Woorpje:
Bounded Word Equation Solver

Woorpje is a string solver for word equations where variables can be substituted only finite length strings.
As variables can only be replaced by finite length strings over a finite alphabet, there are only finitely many substitutions to consider, rendering the question: _is this equation solvable_ trivially solvable by a reachability check.
Preliminary experiments with a naive reachability search revealed however, that the search space quickly becomes intractable thus 
Woorpje translates the Bounded Word Equation problem to a satisfiability problem of propositional logic, and uses the award-winning SAT-solver http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/[Glucose] as its SAT-Solving backend. 


== Using Woorpje: 
Woorpje is invoked from the command line with `./woorpje equation.eq` where `equation.eq` is configuration file for Woorpje.

=== Simple Example
Using Woorpje to solve the equation `aX = YB` is as simple as providing the below configuration file to Woorpje. 

----
include::examples/example.eq[]
----
The lines `Variables` `Terminals` and `Equation` must be written in
that order, and they have the obvious semantics. The last line
`SatGlucose(10)` invokes the solver and pass the number 10 as
parameter to the solver.  The `10` informs the solver to try increase
the exponentially ten times. If the parameter is `0`, Woorpje will guess a suitable value. 

[TIP]
It is possible to specify a system of equations, where all equations must be true, by specifying several `Equation` lines


As can be seen from the output below, Woorpje finds a solution to the equation where it sets `X = b` and `Y = a`. Woorpje also provides a proof that the substitution is correct by outputting the left hand side and right hand side with the variables replaced.

=== Linear Constraints
Woorpje supports constraining the set of potential solutions by specifying constraints between linear arithmetic expressions over the length of the variables. As an example, consider that want solution to `aX = Yb` where `X` is longer than 5, we can add the constraint  `LinConstraint: [ >= +1|X|, +5]` to the configuration file. Linear Constraints must be specified after the word equations. Giving us the configuration file

----
include::examples/linexample.eq[]
----

[TIP]
Linear Constraints are specified in prefix form where the comparison operator (`>=,<=, >, <`) is first specified and after that the left hand side and then the right hand side of comparison.

The output from Woorpje 

----
include::examples/linexample.out[]

reveals that there is indeed a solution. It also shows, that Woorpje encoded the word equation problem into SAT four times.
